Solutions to programming problems
=================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/yasserglez/programming-problems.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/yasserglez/programming-problems)

This repository contains solutions to different programming problems.

The `run_tests.py` script compiles and runs all the programs,
verifying they produce the expected output. Currently it supports
Python (`.py`), Java (`.java`), C (`.c`) and C++ (`.cc`, `.cpp`).
Each program is contained in a single file, and its expected output is
in a file named the same as the program but with the `.out` extension.
Also, if a file with the `.in` extension exists, its content is passed
as the standard input when running the program.
